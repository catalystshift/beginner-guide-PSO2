# A Basic No-Frills PSO 2Newbie Guide 
  ~written on 6th January 2021 by user adventus on Discord(Phantasy Star Fleet)
(written on the assumption that no money is intended to be spent on the game. You can doe, how else you gunna fashun competitively? Fashun endgame. For quite a few folks. Also getting that one more mag. Sexay.)
(Guide goal: To reduce confusion, help you avoid some common mistakes plus give a general guide on how to play the first few weeks of the game!)

Credits to the helpful people of the Fleet Discord's #advice channel without whom I would still be clueless about near everything in this game, in no particular order:
Callyo, Herm, Phantom Lavender, Mirra, nvmvoidrays, Amazing Ampharos, Aihie, Hesloth, Brand New Star, Hespathus, Stroudbun, nasty_wolverine, Qmzn, lazybone95, someone

There are probably people I missed here as the channel is chock full of enthusiasts and people-who-know-their-stuff~! Thank you all!

## What mistakes do I avoid + what do I make sure to do?
**Common Item Mistakes + To-Do's**:
- Don't sell grinders(normal or lambda), ex-cubes, photon anything, synthesizers, Custom Type 'X', Merits/Demerits, materials gotten via Gathering in expeditions, boosters(Triboost, EXP Boost, also items like Photon Boosters), 13* star and above weapons and eggs until you know what you are doing. You may sell basic grinders(never lambda) after keeping aside one stack of 999.
- Do not trash/discard your bonus keys if they are expired.
- Exchange all 10-12 rank weapons you get for ex-cubes via the swap shop(accessed from the menu outside of a quest or on the gateway ship). Like Deo weapons or Sigmas or Nox weapons. There is literally no upper limit on how many ex-cubes you need, so do this liberally, all, the, time.
- Do not sell weapon 13* rank and above or dismantle them or swap for ex-cubes until you are certain you don't need them after later research(you will want the S-Augments page on the NA Visiphone). Unless your inventory is bursting, then, ask around and then do so, saving the important ones.
- If you plan to get into affixing, save weapons and units(low rank ones) that are 7 slot(7s) and above in your inventory. Whatever number you are comfortable with keeping, despite the inventory management issues it will inevitably bring. Thank me later.

**Common Equipment/Class Mistakes + To-Do's**:
- Don't level your skilltree or mag for the sake of equipping a weapon below 13*. In fact, do not do this, ever. It is not needed. Not. Needed.
- Unless its a DEX mag character or you are doing it for collection titles, do NOT get Millionaire weapons over Croesus weapons from the collection folders. Millionaire weapons have far higher DEX requirements which are incredibly hard to reach. Croesus is much easier to equip and is the exact same weapon except with different colors.
Do not run multiple Tokyo Bonus Silver keys at once ideally. Save them(its ok if Tokyo Silvers expire, the idea is to exchange them for Golds during PSO2 Day, 5 for 1 gold key).
- Do not make mixed stat mags.
- Do not bother enhancing weapons below 13* rank in most cases until you reach the point where you get into affixing things. Units you can enhance if skilled play is not your forte and you need the defense, but ideally try and get high rank units instead first(see if any free campaign giveaways are going on, or if cheap high ranks can be bought from Player/personal shop, get a minimum 5 slot if so, you want 12 ranks ideally, if your character can wear that).


**The Easy-To-Forget/Overlook and also supes useful/important things**:
- Don't neglect the Daily Crafting option in your Personal Quarters(both are available from the start). These will get you titles plus other goodies at literally no cost to you(although daily crafts are time locked, which can be removed via Lilliparium items which are again, gifted to you for doing Daily Crafts LOL, from the Title Counter to the right of the Gateway Ship).
- If you are F2P, it is exceedingly important to draw your FUN scratch. FUN is earned for logging in, reviving people, liking things on Lookbook, sending kudos and simply just playing the game. FUN scratch tickets(1000 FUN!) can be bought at the Ex-Cube exchange with ease as well, so you really have no excuse besides inventory management shenanigans to do so. FUN Scratch gives you potentially big rewards in the form of Personal Quarters passes(allows you to change Room Layouts to the bigger ones, letting you play interior designer) and much more importantly, 3 day Personal Shop Passes(rare draw, super worth it) which as you may guess, let you setup your personal shop and sell things for meseta. More importantly, it only controls your ability to ADD items to your shop, you can collect your earnings without shop access and also withdraw items from your shop as well meaning you can add certain important items at obscene prices for the sake of behaving as another 'storage'.
- Save. Your. SG. It will be tempting to use it to purchase Mission Pass tiers, and many other things. Just save it, there are more useful things to spend it on.
- Do not roll AC scratches without asking around and some research, ideally. Save it until you are sure you know what you are buying and why.

**Bonus Key Mistakes plus To-Do's**:
- Tokyo Rainbow Keys are meant for characters over level 85. 90 even. Do not use them on low level characters and ideally use them on PSO2 Day. Only ever use them on low level characters if they are about to expire before PSO2 Day or before one of your characters hits level 90. This is important, Sega does not hand these out like candy.
- Do not run multiple Tokyo Bonus Silver keys at once ideally. Save them(its ok if Tokyo Silvers expire, the idea is to exchange them for Golds during PSO2 Day, 5 for 1 gold key). The intent is to get the most out of your booster items(Exp 75/100s, Triboosts and so on). 5 Tokyo Silvers will give you more EXP in total than one gold, yes, but the amount of time it takes to run those five silvers versus the amount it takes to run multiple golds in the same amount...you don't want to waste boosters, especially once that are rarely handed out such as PSO2 Day Donuts.
