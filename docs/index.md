# A Basic No-Frills PSO 2 Newbie Guide 
**Guide goal: To reduce confusion, help you avoid some common mistakes plus give a general guide on how to play the first few weeks of the game!**

**What this guide WON'T do**:
- Help you install PSO2.
- Help you setup PSO2 Tweaker.
- Provide in-depth information on how to play your class(es).
- Help you determine your end-game gear and augments and what your end-game even is. End-game is somewhat loosely defined in PSO2 as you will see in the relevant section below.

 Written by user adventus on Discord(Phantasy Star Fleet), player ID Equanimity on PSO2 Ship 4.
This guide is written on the assumption that no money is intended to be spent on the game. You can doe, how else you gunna fashun competitively? Fashun endgame. For quite a few folks. Also getting that one more mag. Sexay.

## What ship(server) do I play on?

Ships 1-3, generally. Pick any one, ask around the Phantasy Star Fleet discord for more info. Ship 4 does have players as well but its personal shop is not considered half as good as the ones on Ships 1-3. Ship 1 and 2 are considered to have the best player shops for new players helping reduce some of the grind in getting up to speed for endgame.
Also keep in mind **you cannot play with players from other ships aside from ARKS Battles and Challenge quests, and you can do so only on the Universal Ship**. So if you have online or IRL friends who you are going to play with, make sure you take their Ship choices into consideration.
Finally, **character slots are shared by all ships. You cannot make three characters on every ship, although you can make one separate character on three different ships which isn't recommended because then you can't share items between your toons and lose out on valuable inventory real estate by having all your characters on one ship. Additional characters may be made for 500 AC a pop.**
**Keep in mind if planning to carry over your character from PSO2 to PSO2: New Genesis, you will be on the same Ship in NGS and won't get to switch it.**

## Important items, game features and how to best use them!

**AC, SG, FUN and you!**
- AC is this games premium currency and is used for premium subscriptions, additional Mag devices(an important piece of equipment), additional storage and more. Most importantly and often it is utilized to draw Scratch tickets which are loot boxes for costumes, but can also draw boosters and a few equipment tweaking items. These are often sold on the player shop so as far F2P players go, you may spend some time farming meseta for them but you won't be locked out of the important content, rest assured of that.
- SG can also be bought for money, but is also handed out by finishing story mode, several 'Titles'(explained later in guide), SG tickets handed out by Sega and also daily logins. The main use for SG provided one is good at saving it is purchasing Material Storage which alleviates a lot of inventory management issues, and most importantly, allows materials to be used in the games equipment modifying or crafting systems from the storage itself, lasts for 30 days, per 300 SG spent. Also worth considering is Extended Storage(500 space) for 240 SG for 90 days, but requires manual management and misses out on the QOL feature.

**Important Items and what to do with them**:
- EX-Cubes are an important form of currency as well as crafting material used in making important gear. As currency it is used in the Exchange Shop found on floor two of the shopping plaza. Recommended purchases are Rare Drop Rate 250%s(especially after level 70), level 17 PA/Technique discs, and if you plan to engage with the game's equipment stat tweaking system(called affixing), then Augmentation Aids are especially important.
- Grinders/Lambda Grinders are items used in enhancing weapons and units(units = armor) and rings. Lambda grinders are also used when applying Left Ring skills onto 12 rarity and above units. Basic Grinders may be sold for money after keeping aside at least one stack of 999, although I would go with two stacks.
- Photon Spheres are used on +10, +20 and +30 enhance stages of weapons to unlock their potentials. Each weapon has a hidden potential only activated by enhancing them. Photon Drops and Crystals can be exchanged to spheres. While not recommended in early game, spheres may also be used to buy leveling devices for your Mag.
- Photon Boosters can be used to buy camos, or more importantly can be exchanged for Ultimate Boosters or EXP Weapon Minis.
- Synthesizers are of main use to the Summoner class and its recommended to keep them until you finish leveling them to 75 at least. They are also used for enhancing weapon element levels to 60, although this is not something that's actually needed anymore and is basically a holdover from when PSO2 was just getting started.
- Custom Type 'X' and Merit/Demerit items are used when crafted custom or zero versions of Photon Arts and Techniques, giving you an increased chance of a good outcome.
- Materials gotten via the gathering/fishing minigame in expeditions are used for making food dishes in Franca's Cafe. The Rocks/Jewels specifically are used for enhancing Skill Rings. 
- Rare Drop Rate 250%s, Triboost X%'s, EXP Earned X%'s, Meseta Earned X%'s are all items used to boost the drop/earn rate of the mentioned aspect of the game. Triboost 50's are earned while playing the game normally, but extra care must be taken when using Triboost 100s and especially 150s, as the latter are mostly handed out by Sega or purchased with real money. EX Exp/Tri/RDR work the same and are earned via SG and AC scratches.
- Bonus Keys are earned via Recommended Quests and via the ARKS Mission game feature. They are also handed out by Sega during campaigns. A general rule of thumb is to run them if they are expiring before PSO2 Day with basic boosters on. If one expires, do not trash it. We recommend reading the section on Bonus Keys before using them and for learning what to do with expired keys.
- 13 rarity and above weapons are better not trashed or sold until you have confirmed their main use, whether it is using their Augment Factor via enhancing to 35 or selling on player shop(15 rarity can't be sold) or for dismantling for important materials. 10-12 rarity weapons may be safely exchanged for excubes or photon spheres or lambda grinders via the Swap Shop accessed via the menu(opened by pressing ESC on keyboard).
- "Add Sx: Name Here" where x is a number, are items that add powerful S-Augments onto your weapon or units. They should not be trashed or sold until you know their utility. Please check the section on affixing for more info. Also of note are "Augment X"(X could be (HP&PP3) for example) or "Affix Augment" items, same rules apply to them.
- Egg items contain pets and are mainly used by Summoners and won't drop if not playing the class.
- Candy items are used to strengthen pets and replace the affixing system for Summoners. Neither candy nor eggs will drop if not playing Summoner.

**Important things to note about building characters and Mag Devices**: 
-**Utilize skill tree builds from people who know what they are doing. You cannot reset your skill trees without spending real money or without reset tree passes which are handed out by Sega exceedingly rarely**.
- Character stats are comprised of base stats which are determined by your current level, the skills leveled up in your skill tree and your currently equipped Mag Device, which counts towards your base stats. Your units and weapons are additive in comparison, along with their affixes. An exception are S-Augments on units, such as Fortified Ranged and Fortified Melee, which count towards base stats and are thus affected by buffs.
- Mags are a key piece of equipment handed out by the NPC Kofy at the Quest Counter in the Gate Area, the relevant client order unlocks early and there are ARKS Missions that guide you to do it. Mags both add to your base stats as well feature their own abilities that can heal you, buff you, add to your damage output and also feature Photon Blasts which can add more damage, or utility such as sucking enemies up or recovering your PP. **Do not make mixed stat mags**. You want either a pure MEL, RNG, TEC or DEX mag. This is not min-max advice, the way the game is structured means that mixed stat mags are both worthless and can potentially prevent you from wearing later equipment. Leveling down your mag takes time and meseta, or real money, so get it right at first go. **Every character gets one mag, and they cannot be swapped between characters, additional mags cost real money and follow the same rules.**
- **Don't level your skilltree(stat skills) or mag for the sake of equipping a weapon below 13 unless already part of a build**. In fact, do not do this, ever. It is not needed. Not. Needed.

Recheck/place this elsewherev
- Unless its a DEX mag character or you are doing it for collection titles, do NOT get Millionaire weapons over Croesus weapons from the collection folders. Millionaire weapons have far higher DEX requirements which are incredibly hard to reach. Croesus is much easier to equip and is the exact same weapon except with different colors. It must be noted that Armada UQ is being phased out at the time of writing this, barring new Collection Folders, the new recommended 15 to get will be the Orb weapons from 15 Collection Folder 2. Those merely require Urgent Quest completion. Refer the Calendar on pso2.com or on rappy-burst.com to see when Urgent Quests are on.

- Do not bother enhancing weapons below 13* rank in most cases until you reach the point where you get into affixing things. Units you can enhance if skilled play is not your forte and you need the defense, but ideally try and get high rank units instead first(see if any free campaign giveaways are going on, or if cheap high ranks can be bought from Player/personal shop, get a minimum 5 slot if so, you want 12 ranks ideally, if your character can wear that).
- ^^^^

**The Easy-To-Forget/Overlook and also useful/important things**:
- **Collection folder weapons naturally have an enhance cap of 30**, and thus need more of the same to get them to 35. Same applies to Exchange Shop weapons at the exchange counter on floor two of the shopping plaza.
- This won't be relevant till later, **but note that base weapons acquired at Zig exchanges also come with an enhance cap of 30**(I.E. Profound weapons), *some of these also drop naturally from quests in which case their enhance cap will be 35*(applies to all natural drops that are 13* and above. Below 13* generally have an enhance cap of 30 and need items called Enhance caps or the same weapon type to push it to 35, which you will basically never need to do, so).
- Don't neglect the Daily Crafting option in your Personal Quarters(both are available from the start). These will get you titles plus other goodies at literally no cost to you(although daily crafts are time locked, which can be removed via Lilliparium items which are again, gifted to you for doing Daily Crafts LOL, from the Title Counter to the right of the Gateway Ship).
- **If you are F2P, it is exceedingly important to draw your FUN scratch**. FUN is earned for logging in, reviving people, liking things on Lookbook, sending kudos and simply just playing the game. FUN scratch tickets(1000 FUN!) can be bought at the Ex-Cube exchange with ease as well, so you really have no excuse besides inventory management shenanigans to do so. FUN Scratch gives you potentially big rewards in the form of Personal Quarters passes(allows you to change Room Layouts to the bigger ones, letting you play interior designer) and much more importantly, **3 day Personal Shop Passes**(rare draw, super worth it) which as you may guess, let you setup your personal shop and sell things for meseta. More importantly, it only controls your ability to ADD items to your shop, you can collect your earnings without shop access and also withdraw items from your shop as well meaning you can add certain important items at obscene prices for the sake of behaving as another 'storage'.
- *Save. Your. SG.* It will be tempting to use it to purchase Mission Pass tiers, and many other things. Just save it, there are more useful things to spend it on.
- **Do not roll AC scratches without asking around and some research**, ideally. Save it until you are sure you know what you are buying and why.

**Bonus Keys and How to Use Them**:
- **Tokyo Rainbow Keys are meant for characters over level 80. Do not use Rainbows on characters below 80 and ideally use them on PSO2 Day**. Only ever use them on low level characters if they are about to expire before PSO2 Day or before one of your characters hits level 80. This is important, Sega does not hand these out like candy. Bonus Keys scale up to level 80.
- **Do not run multiple Tokyo Bonus Silver keys at once ideally**. Save them(its ok if Tokyo Silvers expire, the idea is to exchange them for Golds during PSO2 Day, 5 for 1 gold key). The intent is to get the most out of your booster items(Exp 75/100s, Triboosts and so on). 5 Tokyo Silvers will give you more EXP in total than one gold, yes, but the amount of time it takes to run those five silvers versus the amount it takes to run multiple golds in the same amount...you don't want to waste boosters, especially once that are rarely handed out such as PSO2 Day Donuts.
- As a low level player with a DEX mag, you may want to consider buying a Occuld or Sigma launcher off the player shop if your clear times are too long. They may help reduce them.
- Ideally run keys on PSO2 Day(2nd of every month + also on 22nd if you are premium) with boosters on, unless your keys will expire before then.

## What tasks are best focused on as a new player?

Practice patience. I am not trolling you, I am dead serious, read through this guide and then pick a class, and read through its guide but skip its equipment section for now. You are about to play a game that is rushing through 8 years of content, watch this to get an idea(thank you Anamana!): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu0HRBJko48]

Its easy to get overwhelmed with this game, but if you let it, it will eventually start washing over you and sinking in. 
Now, to the point:
**Ask yourself if you are OK with spreading the classes around or if you need to play all of them optimally(or even just effectively) on one character**. For the latter, you will need to spend money on something called a Mag, three mags to be exact. Not too expensive and very doable/feasible. If you don't want to do that and are OK with spreading your classes around...

1. *Fill out your three free character slots first and foremost*. Frankly this is recommended either way. More characters equals more goodies whenever Sega hands out character specific goods like Reset Skill Tree passes. Race doesn't matter for moment to moment gameplay and has exceedingly limited impact on stats(magic/technique using CASTs aren't uncommon for example), so pick and make what you like. You can change everything except gender down the line. Then -

  - Pick any one character to play, and go.

  - Early on you will receive an item called a Mag. **This thing is extremely important and must remain not-fucked-up**. Look at me, you, will, not, fuck, this, up,       unless you have money to burn and want to do it as a joke, but I recommend charities instead. Every character gets its own mag, it cannot be traded to other           characters or players.
    To avoid guide bloat, here is a link as to how to level a pure stat mag: https://forum.pso2.com/topic/538/tips-guide-raising-pure-mags-revised-2-5
    One thing not mentioned there: Food devices can also be bought from the player shop, not just Photon Drop Exchange. This can be bearable/cheap-ish depending on how     well you are managing your meseta gathering. Compare ship prices and decide if you want to take that plunge, or if you are OK with mag leveling taking some time.

  - Play your first character focusing on Cofy's client orders plus Daily/Weekly ARKS Missions. Cofy can be found on the right side of the gate area at the quest           counter, also memorize the location of Equipment Officer Prin to the right of her(your right, her left). Cofy's orders unlock additional missions, classes and game     important features. Any time you see an order to the effect of introducing a new mechanic or unlocking something, prioritize it. Doing this will take you through       quite a few missions and game mechanics.

  - At the same time, go to Prin on the right. Pick out three weapons for your collection sheet(ignore the 13* rank sheets, go straight to 15*). Pick at least one         Croesus weapon related to the class you are playing(if Armada is no longer in rotation, pick an Orb) and pick one Orb weapon(the end goal of this weapon will           either be enhancing fodder or be used for its augment factor. Don't worry about it if you don't get what I mean, just get any Orb weapon, and whenever the sheet       fills out and gets available again, usually after 48 hours, reclaim the same weapons sheet again for a total of six times). Note – get Croesus weapons for             whichever class you are looking to switch to(or Orbs) after playing around with the current for a while. Keep doing so until you have Croesus for every class. If       Luminmechs are hard to come by, you could go for Orbs instead.

  - Do Urgent Quests when they pop up with boosters on. Specifically, Triboost 100%/50% and Rare Drop Rate 250%. Triboosts are often handed out by Sega and after           playing for a while you will likely end up with multiple 100s, for now, you will earn 50s via logins or the daily ARKS Missions(not quests, its a menu thing, you       fulfill conditions and get rewards). This will get your collection sheet filled out. Do not solo them until you know what you are doing.

  - Ideally, find an Alliance to join. Next to the level up dude within the gate area is the Alliance Officer. Setup up your profile according to your preferences and     either wait or actively seek out alliances. Alliances provide additional orders to fulfill plus the invaluable Buff Tree which boost your EXP rates, rare drop         rates and so on, and of course provide people to play with and so on. Note that Alliances are account bound and Ship bound, not per character. Each of your alts       will belong to the same alliance and you only have the option of joining Alliances that exist on your chosen Ship!

2. Once your Cofy orders are done and you have a better idea of whats what – your next biggest task is spamming Recommended Quest 4 until all your classes reach level 75 once, no matter the character used to reach lvl 75 with. This provides account wide boosts to stats for all your characters no matter the class being played, which is invaluable and needed for endgame. You only need to reach 75 once with every class, no matter the character you reach it with. You don't need to reach 75 say twice or thrice, that is, for example, 75 with Hunter on characters A, B and C. Reaching 75 on Hunter with Character A will unlock the buff for everyone. Note: please also refer the section on Bonus Keys down below if you are considering using them for leveling.

**This should not be ignored as getting your bases to 75 can play into everything from your DPS to whether you can even equip certain things.**
Here are the class boosts offered by each class: 
![Class Boosts](https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/DwG0m-I1xMwzxQAYp4iK8EODXDyq330x1Fi6vwCQ5ZE/https/images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/AJCMiUqyynRJH1V5maF2-sW_RRTRUI2girwyiIeA54o/https/images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/s6C22qpXIteuW1H75GoSgewYnBInKsf01egZbIfudJ8/https/i.imgur.com/onj7Mho.png)

3. Have you reached level 75 on two classes? You will unlock Scion classes at this point. Hero, Phantom, Etoile and Luster. Scions/successor classes have their own special mechanics and gameplay styles and provide no boosts at level 75 and cannot carry a subclass(although Ph, Et and Lu can be used as subclass for base classes, sometimes invalidating base+base combos outright because the scions just offer better bonuses lol). Play around with them but prioritize level 75'ing the remaining bases if you haven't yet.

4. The next step after this is determining which class you want to main or play with for a while. Once you have picked that plus its subclass if relevant, its time to level these to 85 separately for unlocking the final difficulty(Ultra Hard) and gaining access to current and future endgame content. Again, use RQ4 for this plus UQ's and EXP tickets. This is also a great time to look into how the class plays in more detail if you haven't already, content after level 75 starts punishing bad play so you want to learn better PA rotations and other nooks and crannies about your chosen class. Yes, I just told you to git gud lmao. Keep in mind that the absolute final end game content requires either a 90 scion class or if using a base class, 90 on both the base and the chosen subclass.

5. As you approach Ultra Hard, its generally also a good time to start looking into affixing. This is addressed below in a basic manner with in-depth guides to be found on the PSO2 Fleet discord and youtube.

6. Its also finally time to start exploring Zig weapon exchanges! Zig is the black CAST found next to the enhancement/affixing lab, and is responsible for all endgame gear! If you've reached this point, you have no business reading this, and I implore you to seek out guides more suited to this task or to take to the Discord :)

## How do I approach Urgent Quests?
Early on most of the content is simple enough that you won't have to think too hard about this and can wing it mostly. As you approach XH difficulty however, its recommended to look up video guides if you find yourself having trouble and maybe start considering finding specific groups to run those quests with(Discord makes this easy, as does belonging to an Alliance) as PUGs(public games or pick-up-groups) can often contain players who may not know what they are doing(which is A-OK and can be part of the fun but not helpful if you are trying to farm or get specific things done). Either run a general Youtube search or check out the channels recommended in the Resources section.

## Affixing

The bane of many a people. If you are a very skilled player and don't easily kiss the floor and are good at learning boss patterns, you could skip this. However, learning how the system works can bring benefits to any player and lead to more well-rounded and powerful characters, after all, you are playing an RPG. That said, PSO2 is very casual friendly and lenient, and you can completely ignore this mechanic until you hit UH(Ultra Hard) if you so wish. UH, its advisable to partake and make use of it but a very skilled player can still get by without(but obviously at more risk to themselves and with less efficacy during MPA quests plus urgents).
The base concepts are simple but the game does a horrible job of teaching them. In-depth guides can be found on the Fleet discord plus on youtube with the affixing simulator also simplifying things a lot, my task is to help you understand some basic things/avoid a few common mistakes:
   - Affixing requires two or more items. The non-main items(the ones you choose after the first one, called fodders) used in affixing need to hold the same number of      “slots”(augments) as the base or main item you first choose, or need to have a higher amount.
   
  - Below 8 slots, you will notice the option to add an additional affix whenever affixing, with reduced success rates for every other affix if attempted. This is         called upslotting and can be made easier with Augmentation Aids which are acquired via ARKS Missions, some titles, and more frequently and reliably at steep-ish       costs that even out around UH at the EX-Cube Exchange Shop(shopping plaza, floor 2 right side from the entrance). 8 slots are the maximum you can have. Each           upslot has increased risk with 8s being the riskiest to make. 
    Downslot by contrast is where you purposely take a weapon anf re-affix it, but choose one less than the amount of augments it already holds, thereby reducing its       amount. This can be relevant for if you find high slot affixes too challenging or heavy on your meseta/ex-cubes, and want to go for a lower slot number that will       be easier for you.

  - Using items with the same name leads to increased affixing success % chance, but each item needs to be the literal same. If even one fodder differs, the bonus is       lost.

  - Augmenting is made easier with augment factors, an augment that shows up during affixing with every weapon once enhanced to maximum(35). Augment factors are also       subject to upslot penalties, but the base 100% success rate plus the fact you can reuse it endlessly when upslotting the 35+ weapon makes it very valuable. More       importantly, certain augments are best gotten via augment factors, such as Reverie Catalysts from any Profound series weapon thats been enhanced to 35.

  - Augments also come as s-augments, which generally come either in capsules or with specific 13* and above weapons or as augment factors(generally 13* and above         only). Only weapon type with s-aug compatibility(shown in the info window) can use them, being compatible with anywhere from S1 to S5. S-Augs can be transferred       with 100% success rates between weapons with the Transfer S-Augment option, although the weapon giving away the S-Aug will be downslotted unless an s-aug is           transferred from the main onto it. S-Augs are also unaffected by upslotting or affixing penalties, essentially making them 'safe slots' for your                       upslotting/affixing business that you don't need to worry about.

  - Even useless S-grade augments are worth keeping for the sole purpose of making high slot affixes less risky. If the weapon is important and about to be upslotted,     slap some s-augs on it if supported and watch the entire process become ten times more bearable because the game can no longer troll you by failing your 90% affix     success rate by downslotting you to two, from six. Yes thank you this did happen to me and yes I agree it sucked thanks so muchhhhh.

  - The same principles apply to units as well. The caveat is only a few units possess augment factors, meaning synthesized augments such as Mana Reverie are a pain to     make on them compared to weapons which can utilize augment factor from Profounds to make that one with relative ease. This is why you save your Augment Transfer       Passes for your units as they are a pain to acquire.
  
  - When enhancing weapons to 35 for their SAF, prioritize using collection folder weapons from 15 CF1 and 2 or the 13* collection folder. All of them drop at +30 and     reduce the lambda grinders you need and quickly plus 10 your weapon one 30 CF weapon at a time.
  
  Also helpful to know is that the gameplay difference between 7 slots and 8 slots is not too massive(although this may not apply to a certain endgame weapon that has not arrived at the time of writing this), so if 8 slot is too intimidating for you, 7 slots is perfectly fine. Hell, go 6 slots, just...try to get good-ish affixes, even if budget.

## Bonus Keys and how to best use them!

Firstly: **Rainbows only on characters above level 80**. This, is, important. OK, carry on.
Save your Tokyo silvers, golds and rainbows, rappy fevers and kazuchi assaults for PSO2 Day unless they are expiring. Use your Magatsu keys as soon as you have them(they give bonus SG which is an important ingame currency, the other things are negligible.). 
**On PSO2 Day, 2nd of the month for F2P Players, 22nd for premium sub players**, *exchange all your expired silvers for golds and then mass rush your keys on the classes/characters that need them with ALL your boosters on*, RDR 250, the highest EXP booster you have, the highest Triboost, any EX boosts. Ideally save EX boosts for rainbows unless you are confident the relevant keys will get run while that booster is still on.
The idea is to maximize booster mileage, so you pop less boosters per key spam event and get more use out of each, which is important because powerful ones like Tri 150%s or EX boosts are not handed out often or easily acquired unless spending real money like nobody's business.

## Where can I get X important item from?

- Ex-cubes are acquired via swapping 10-12* grade weapons for ex-cubes in the swap shop(the one accessed from menu), commonly. They are also given as rewards for CO's, ARKS Missions, titles and urgent quest rewards. 

- Grinders/lambda grinders are earned via ARKS Missions/CO's as well. One can also exchange 12* weapons for lambdas if really needed. In a pinch, you can get them from the casino and you will notice they are also an option for several exchange shops for different items such as Buster and Divide Medals. The last option is not really recommended as there are better uses for those items. More importantly, as they are relevant for enhancing things they only become relevant once you hit XH and UH, so...just play normally and most likely you will have quite a bit by the time you need them.

- Triggers(items that let you do urgent quests) can be bought at Rising Weapon Badge exchanges(same row as the ex-cube exchange shop). This is important for later farming purposes. Some 4 man triggers also drop from their 12 man versions(generally called rematches, for example, Call of the Void dropping from The Malevolent Void trigger). 4 mans can have better and more reliable drop rates at times.

- Photon Spheres are the same logic as grinders, earned via normal play. Additionally, useless  12* units can be exchanged for spheres, 5 for a single sphere. Or, if swimming in ex-cubes, you could consider swapping 10-11*s for them.

- YOU FOOL! I NEED MONEY, MESETA IS LIFE, MESETA IS BLOOD, WHY WOULD YOU BORE ME WITH THIS MEANINGLESS TRIPE! ASDASGDVASHFV ahem. The best advice for meseta is this: Do your weeklies and dailies, and look out for high meseta daily orders(specifically Bar Lodos for 250K meseta). Another option that gives OK meseta but is time consuming is spamming extreme quests, specifically ruins & oceanids extreme at stages 36-40. They spawn an order to kill 100 enemies in 100 seconds that gives good meseta. A much better and RNG dependent method is opening a player shop, player shop passes can be earned by drawing FUN scratch tickets(very low chance), which is something you want to be doing frequently. Thankfully 1000 FUN tickets are easily bought at the Ex-Cube exchange shop, so inventory management is the only real problem lol. Save valuable items(check via 'Check Item Market Prices') and then put them up for sale once you get your 3 day personal shop pass! FUN is earned by regular play, liking things on lookbook, sending kudos' and other thigns.

- 'I need this augment...' check the wiki! They often have drop locations or equipment listed! If not listed or you can't find it, come ask in the PSO2 Fleet discord :)

- Diard/Plania/GolX/Sapphard – These are earned by dismantling 13* and above weapons. Diards via 15* dismantling. In essence if you are looking at Zig exchanges thinking about this, don't worry about it until you hit UH.

- Chronos Eternistone, Founders Amphitrite and Key Rivalates' are exceedingly rare drops from quite a few Ultra Hard quests such as Wisdom Incarnate and The Malevolent Void, and otherwise can be earned as title rewards(especially title milestones, going up to 800 titles for a Rivalate Key).

- Void Erebite Fragments for Zig exchange Profound/Starquake/Trailblazer weapon and units can be farmed in the quests The Malevolent Void and The Call of the Void.

- Ultimate Boosters drop from most Ultra Hard quests.

- Luminfragment Emels + Granias are acquired by doing Divide Quests enough times to earn the required points. Stages 1-10 are used more often for Divide Medal farming, whereas 20+ are used for Divide Points. This however is high level content so you won't need to think about it for a while. Once ready, look up guides to Divide Quests as it can be a bit tricky(and also fun AF) to do em.

## What even is endgame in PSO2?
Many MMO's have specific raids  that can only be done via top tier weapon and well built classes. This sn't the case with PSO2, where even poorly skilled(skill tree or reflexes) players can technically tackle the highest level content. PSO2 has no definitive final goal, except the one you set for yourself.
Here's my take on endgame: 
You either fashion competitively, or you go the DMC/character action games route - try to get better at the game and see how well you can tackle certain quests or bosses(the endgame ones specifically), how fast, how high you can get your DPS. Think Depth 999 Masquerade(Ultimate Quest: Remnants of a Parallel World).
And or affixing shenanigans, can you get ALL the endgame affixes without losing your mind?
Or do you just do the story and tap out till another update?
Will you make a machinima series out of PSO2?
Make of it what you will, and more importantly, have fun with it :)
