# EDITING ON PAUSE, GUIDE IN REVIEW, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK
# A Basic No-Frills PSO 2 Newbie Guide 
**Guide goal: To reduce confusion, help you avoid some common mistakes plus give a general guide on how to play the first few weeks of the game!**

**What this guide WON'T do**:
- Help you install PSO2.
- Help you setup PSO2 Tweaker.
- Provide in-depth information on how to play your class(es).
- Help you determine your end-game gear and augments and what your end-game even is. End-game is somewhat loosely defined in PSO2 as you will see in the relevant section below.

 Written by user adventus on Discord(Phantasy Star Fleet), player ID Equanimity on PSO2 Ship 4.
This guide is written on the assumption that no money is intended to be spent on the game. You can doe, how else you gunna fashun competitively? Fashun endgame. For quite a few folks. Also getting that one more mag. Sexay.

## On the Basics

### What ship(server) do I play on?

Ships 1-3, generally. Pick any one, ask around the Phantasy Star Fleet discord for more info. Ship 4 does have players as well but its personal shop is not considered half as good as the ones on Ships 1-3. Ship 1 and 2 are considered to have the best player shops for new players helping reduce some of the grind in getting up to speed for endgame.
Also keep in mind **you cannot play with players from other ships aside from ARKS Battles and Challenge quests, and you can do so only on the Universal Ship**. So if you have online or IRL friends who you are going to play with, make sure you take their Ship choices into consideration.
Finally, **character slots are shared by all ships. You cannot make three characters on every ship, although you can make one separate character on three different ships which isn't recommended because then you can't share items between your toons and lose out on valuable inventory real estate by having all your characters on one ship. Additional characters may be made for 500 AC a pop.**
**Keep in mind if planning to carry over your character from PSO2 to PSO2: New Genesis, you will be on the same Ship in NGS and won't get to switch it.**

### How Pay-To-Win is this game?

PSO2 is one of the better examples inf the F2P market by virtue of it being relatively casual and not pay-to-win. Premium players get access to 2 premium 'drinks', a buff item one can take before any quest, but the buff is not large enough to offset the need to play well for certain content. In the end, skill rules the game. 
Other differences are mostly quality-of-life things, with those being willing to shell out money having access to increased inventory and storage sizes, drawing scratch ticket(lootboxes) for fashion items that are also often sold on Personal Shops that even F2P players can purchase from. 
**In short, you will never have to pay money to be competent at this game or to gear well**, although paying money will add some QOL features to your game you are otherwise locked out of, and even then, not every one of those - refer the section on the SG currency below to understand how.

### All this bores me, I wanna get into the game!

While we do recommend reading through the guide, PSO2 is exceedingly simple to just get started with. **That said, for those looking for the recommended way to reach endgame as fast as possible, please Ctrl+F: "What tasks do I focus on as a new player?" or scroll below. It features a step by step process.** 
After character creation, you will be launched into the tutorial quest, if you have never played PSO2 before we recommend saying 'yes' when it asks you if you want a tutorial and choosing casual difficulty when it asks you again for that. 
After completing tutorial you will find yourself in the Gate Area, and be shown an introductory video which will also mention **ARKS Missions**.

**ARKS Missions**

From the main menu(ESC on keyboard) go to the quests tab(globe icon) and ARKS Missions is at the top. In the Missions dialogue box, you will find Main, Daily, Weekly, Limited Time, and Tier.
- Main Missions are checklist of objectives that moves you through the game's base features and gets you used to them while providing rewards for completing each mission. These are only refreshed/updated once you receive the completed missions reward, so ensure you do so.
- Daily Missions refresh everyday and are utilized for earning 'Bonus Keys' as well as fulfilling the Weekly mission for fulfilling 15 Dailies for a Tokyo Bonus Key: Gold.
- Weekly Missions are one of your main sources of Meseta and the mentioned gold key.
- Tier Missions are utilized for unlocking tiers on the ongoing Mission Pass, which can feature important rewards such as endgame materials.
Of all of these, your priority as a new player will be the Main Missions. You will notice one that says 'Clear Forest Expedition'. Which brings us to...

**Client Orders**

Wait, those aren't expeditions?? No! Its another important game feature!
You might have noticed ~~Brofin the broest of bros~~ Afin, your new friend from the tutorial in the Gate Area just walking back and forth, with a blue icon over his head. That icon indicates an NPC has 'Client Orders' to complete. In early game, various NPC's provide Client Orders(CO's) that help you understand the game's basic systems, **and the Main Missions will often guide you to those orders, which is why we recommend following Main Mission order and receiving reward upon each completion to prevent having to redo CO's(where applicable)**.

Client Orders range from hunting down different enemy types and bosses to gathering various items on the field or just S-ranking different quests and so on.
Of special note are the Daily Order Officer and Officer Cofy, found to the left and right in the Gate Area respectively.
- Daily Order Officer offers CO's that change on a daily basis and award good meseta and experience on some of them, **particularly one called "Suppress Bar Lodos"** which gives about 250,000 Meseta on completion. **More important are the five orders at top with blue upwards arrows on them, these add to your Daily Boost**, a boost type explained in the Boosts section below.
- **Officer Cofy is integral and actually manages content unlocks, from additional quest types to even class unlocks and certain special attacks**. Your Main Missions will eventually guide you towards completing her CO's!

**Expeditions**

Expeditions will be something you return to over and over and is one of the first things new players do. They can be started by either heading to your right to the Quest Counter NPC and speaking to her(Main Quests > Expeditions) or via simply heading out the gate and choosing Forest Exploration and choosing Normal Difficulty.
On expeditions, (behind the black booth, to the right of the white booth) your main goal is to reach the final area and defeat the boss, defeating enemies along the way and occasionally destroying green/blue/orange/red boxes for loot. That's it. Its an ideal time to get used to how your class plays, the Photon Arts(Melee/ranged classes) or Techniques you currently possess(tech classes, PSO2's magic, basically). 

-

After competion, you can return to the ARKS Missions menu, select 'Receive All Rewards' and then keep following the Main Missions as they refresh. This is recommended because if you rush around doing CO's before they show up in the Main Missions they won't always register as having being completed and may require you to do redo them, leading to an unnecessary waste of time.
After this, you may continue just following the Main Missions until you feel you are ready to read this guide in more depth or others.
If you find items you are confused by or question what to do with them, please consult the Important Items list right below this section as its possible it might be listed.
OR
We do still recommend at least looking at the list of **Important Items** right below this section as PSO2 has several useful items that are prone to misuse by players new to the game, and being aware of these will help you avoid those mistakes. 

###

## Important items, game features and how to best use them!

**AC, SG, FUN and you!**
- AC is this games premium currency and is used for premium subscriptions, additional Mag devices(an important piece of equipment), additional storage and more. Most importantly and often it is utilized to draw Scratch tickets which are loot boxes for costumes, but can also draw boosters and a few equipment tweaking items. **These are often sold on the player shop so as far F2P players go, you may spend some time farming meseta for purchasing them but you won't be locked out of the important content**, rest assured of that.
- SG can also be bought for money, but is also handed out by finishing story mode, several 'Titles'(explained later in guide), SG tickets handed out by Sega and also daily logins. The **main recommended use for SG provided one is good at saving it is purchasing Material Storage which alleviates a lot of inventory management issues, and most importantly, allows materials to be used in the games equipment modifying or crafting systems from the storage itself, lasts for 30 days, per 300 SG spent**. Also worth considering is Extended Storage(500 space) for 240 SG for 90 days, but requires manual management and misses out on the QOL feature. One may also purchase additional Collection Folder sheets for SG at 700 pop, worth considering if you play regularly and for a long time, but not really needed.
- FUN points are earned upon login as well as several ingame activities and are **primarily used for drawing FUN Scratch Tickets, which as a F2P player would be your primary source of Personal Quarter Access and Personal Shop Pass items**, the former lets you access two larger Personal Quarter layouts and **the latter lets you sell items on your Personal Shop**.

**Mission Pass**

PSO2's take on Battle Passes featuring unlockable rewards that can be earned via the completion of Tier Missions that provide everything from costumes to valuable crafting materials. If you have enough SG saved up, you can even purchase a Mission Pass Gold ticket allowing you to take rewards from gold tiers as well!
In other words, yes, you can get items from this even as a completely F2P player without much trouble.

**Features**
***PSO2 Day***:
On the 2nd and 22nd of every month, for F2P/premium and premium players respectively, this day features increased EXP gain, drop rates as well meseta earned. Its a prime day to level those classes which have been left neglected and earn their leveling titles! Also of note is February 2nd where PSO2 Day becomes Ultra PSO2 Day, featuring a whopping 400% incease in experience gain!

*Booster Items*:
Items such as EXP Earned +X%, Rare Drop Rate(RDR) +X%, Triboost +X% as well as EX Triboost +X%. These both make leveling far easier as well as increase the amount of valuable loot you can get. **For F2P players, the most important are EXP 75% and RDR 25%, easily acquired from exchange shops**. Triboost 50's are earned via doing daily missions every day, and 100s and 150s are both handed out by Sega as well as earned via several titles. EX Triboosts are generally only acquired via SG Scratch or AC Scratch.

*Enhancing and Affixing*:
Enhancing can be thought of as this game's weapon and armor strengthening system while affixing can be thought of as weapon and armor stat customization. These are large topics best covered by their own guides, but are addressed to some degree below in the guide.

*Collection Folder*:
To the right of Officer Kofy you have *Equipment Officer Prin* who handles your Collection Folder(CF) sheets. Each CF features weapons or eggs of high rarity of use to all classes, and has requirements ranging from beating a particular enemy type to doing certain quests to recieve the final item. Of particular note are the Croesus/Millionaire weapons, generally recommended as the baseline 15 rarity weapon to new players. However, the Armada series of urgent quests are no longer run so often making them a bit harder to acquire, if this proves to be the case, the next best thing is the Orb series from 15* Collection Folder 2.
You will want to accept three sheets as soon as you can and start working towards them, ideally just the 15 rarity sheets as 13 rarity weapons can be bought of the player shop at fairly cheap prices. **Please note that Croesus is recommended over Millionaire as both are the same series with different skins, with Croesus having a lower stat requirement allowing them to be equipped earlier than Millionaire which few classes can equip without having a DEX mag**.
Collection Folder weapons are also utilized as Enhancement fodder for this game's 'weapon improvement' system, called enhancing, with every weapon in and after rank 13 having an enhancement cap of +35. A single CF weapon at +30 can take one from 1 to 10, gated only by Photon Spheres required to unlock 'weapon potentials' at enhance level 10, 20 and 30. That said, note that **CF weapons themselves have an enhance cap of 30, requiring the exact same weapon to be enhanced to 35, such as getting a Bayonect Orb sheet filled six times to level it to 35, the 1st base weapon, and five enhancement fodders for 1 per level**.

*Swap/Exchange Shops*:
- The main swap shop can be easily accessed via the main menu > the second last menu > Swap Shop. Here is where you will exchange rarity 10-12 weapons for ex-cubes and photon spheres, you will revisit this menu quite a lot.
- The NPC handling all Swap Shops is found in the Shopping Plaza in the top left corner on the ground floor. Most important is the Class Ex-Cube exchange for Augment Transfer Passes, allowing you to get a certain amount every month for class cubes which are earned from the highest difficulty and level ups beyond the last level. Of note is the Mission Badge Swap Shop which will be of use later and features Augment Capsules that can be useful for your endgame affixing, do not buy these without research. 
- Exchange Shops are found on the second floor of the Shopping Complex on the right side of the map. The **Photon Drop and EX-Cube exchanges provide you with your booster items**(along with other things). **Rising Weapon Badges feature high rarity equipment(some of which can also be bought on player shop or farmed) and more importantly, Quest Triggers which is how you can manually run Urgent Quests. Not every trigger is available in RWB shops yet but many important ones exist**. The Medal Barterer is where you exchange Divide Medals for Luminfragments as well as Granias, both important items for the final endgame weapon series(not yet released).

*Titles*:
Titles can be earned for accomplishing several different objectives while playing the game, and aside from giving you catchy names to showcase over your ingame character name, they give rewards ranging from SG to **account wide stat boosts upon each class(barring Hero, Phantom, Etoile and Luster) reaching level 75 for the first time** to **Augment Transfer Passes to even endgame weapon crafting materials**. Titles are managed by the officer near the gate in the Gateway Area, right next to the quest counter on the right, behind a white counter. You can receive the title rewards whenever you wish, and its not uncommon to discover her after several rewards have already been unlocked. There are also titles with said crafting material rewards locked behind 600, 700 and 800 titles.

*Personal Shop*:
Not to be ignored at any cost, this will help a player at any level as well as act as a potential source of income if you get lucky earning Shop Passes from FUN Scratch or are a Premium player.
Accessed via the Visiphone(terminal with a pink icon over it), the Personal Shop features all manner of items from augments to fashion earned via AC scratch and put up to sale for meseta to equipment ranging from 1 rarity all the way to 14 rarity(15 weapons can't be sold, neither can 13 units). Its a common practice for new players to get 10-12 rarity weapons from the shop during early leveling as well as 12 rarity units whenever they become capable of wearing them from the same.

*Daily Crafting*:
The Daily Crafting feature is in your Personal Quarters(both are available from the start). These will get you titles plus other goodies at literally no cost to you(although daily crafts are time locked, which can be removed via Lilliparium items which are again, gifted to you for doing Daily Crafts, from the Title Counter to the right of the Gateway Ship). Getting these done regularly is recommended.

**Important Items and what to do with them**:
*Currencies*:
- EX-Cubes are an important form of currency **as well as crafting material used in making important gear**. As currency it is used in the Exchange Shop found on floor two of the shopping plaza. Recommended purchases are Rare Drop Rate 250%s(especially after level 70), level 17 PA/Technique discs, and if you plan to engage with the game's equipment stat tweaking system(called affixing), then Augmentation Aids are especially important.
- Grinders/Lambda Grinders are items used in enhancing weapons and units(units = armor) and rings. Lambda grinders are also used when applying Left Ring skills onto 12 rarity and above units. Basic Grinders may be sold for money after keeping aside at least one stack of 999, although I would go with two stacks.
- Photon Spheres are used on +10, +20 and +30 enhance stages of weapons to unlock their potentials. Each weapon has a hidden potential only activated by enhancing them. Photon Drops and Crystals can be exchanged to spheres. While not recommended in early game, spheres may also be used to buy leveling devices for your Mag.
- Photon Boosters can be used to buy camos, or more importantly can be exchanged for Ultimate Boosters or EXP Weapon Minis.
- Synthesizers are of main use to the Summoner class and its recommended to keep them until you finish leveling them to 75 at least. They are also used for enhancing weapon element levels to 60, although this is not something that's actually needed anymore and is basically a holdover from when PSO2 was just getting started.

*Crafting Materials*:
- Custom Type 'X' and Merit/Demerit items are used when crafting custom or zero versions of Photon Arts and Techniques via Crafter Search or in your Personal Quarters, giving you an increased chance of a good outcome.
- Materials gotten via the gathering/fishing minigame in expeditions are used for making food dishes in Franca's Cafe. The Rocks/Jewels specifically are used for enhancing Skill Rings. 
- "Add Sx: Name Here" where x is a number, are items that add powerful S-Augments onto your weapon or units. They should not be trashed or sold until you know their utility. Please check the section on affixing for more info. Also of note are "Augment X"(X could be (HP&PP3) for example) or "Affix Augment" items, same rules apply to them.

*Boosters/Leveling Aids*:
- Rare Drop Rate 250%s, Triboost X%'s, EXP Earned X%'s, Meseta Earned X%'s are all items used to boost the drop/earn rate of the mentioned aspect of the game. Triboost 50's are earned while playing the game normally, but extra care must be taken when using Triboost 100s and especially 150s, as the latter are mostly handed out by Sega or purchased with real money. EX Exp/Tri/RDR work the same and are earned via SG and AC scratches.
- Bonus Keys are earned via Recommended Quests and via the ARKS Mission game feature. They are also handed out by Sega during campaigns. A general rule of thumb is to run them if they are expiring before PSO2 Day with basic boosters on. If one expires, do not trash it. We recommend reading the section on Bonus Keys before using them and for learning what to do with expired keys.

*Equipment*:
- 13 rarity and above weapons are better not trashed or sold until you have confirmed their main use, whether it is using their Augment Factor via enhancing to 35 or selling on player shop(15 rarity can't be sold) or for dismantling for important materials. 10-12 rarity weapons may be safely exchanged for excubes or photon spheres or lambda grinders via the Swap Shop accessed via the menu(opened by pressing ESC on keyboard). If your level is low and you are unable to purhcase/wear better equipment from the player shop, you may use them as placeholders.
- Egg items contain pets and are mainly used by Summoners and won't drop if not playing the class with a few quest unique exceptions such as the Armada: Final Lament Urgent Quest which can can drop a 14 rarity Vulcan egg even if not playing as a Summoner.
- Candy items are used to strengthen pets and replace the affixing system for Summoners. Neither candy nor eggs will drop if not playing Summoner.



**Important things to note about building characters and Mag Devices**: 
-**Utilize skill tree builds from people who know what they are doing. You cannot reset your skill trees without spending real money or without reset tree passes which are handed out by Sega exceedingly rarely**.
- Character stats are comprised of base stats which are determined by your current level, the skills leveled up in your skill tree and your currently equipped Mag Device, which counts towards your base stats. Your units and weapons are additive in comparison, along with their affixes. An exception are S-Augments on units, such as Fortified Ranged and Fortified Melee, which count towards base stats and are thus affected by buffs.
- Mags are a key piece of equipment handed out by the NPC Kofy at the Quest Counter in the Gate Area, the relevant client order unlocks early and there are ARKS Missions that guide you to do it. Mags both add to your base stats as well feature their own abilities that can heal you, buff you, add to your damage output and also feature Photon Blasts which can add more damage, or utility such as sucking enemies up or recovering your PP. **Do not make mixed stat mags**. You want either a pure MEL, RNG, TEC or DEX mag. This is not min-max advice, the way the game is structured means that mixed stat mags are both worthless and can potentially prevent you from wearing later equipment. Leveling down your mag takes time and meseta, or real money, so get it right at first go. **Every character gets one mag, and they cannot be swapped between characters, additional mags cost real money and follow the same rules.**
- **Don't level your skilltree(stat skills) or mag for the sake of equipping a weapon below 13 unless already part of a build**. In fact, do not do this, ever. It is not needed. Not. Needed.

## What tasks are best focused on as a new player?

Practice patience. I am not trolling you, I am dead serious, read through this guide and then pick a class, and read through its guide but skip its equipment section for now. You are about to play a game that is rushing through 8 years of content, watch this to get an idea(thank you Anamana!): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu0HRBJko48]

Its easy to get overwhelmed with this game, but if you let it, it will eventually start washing over you and sinking in. 
Now, to the point:
**Ask yourself if you are OK with spreading the classes around or if you need to play all of them optimally(or even just effectively) on one character**. For the latter, you will need to spend money on something called a Mag, three mags to be exact. Not too expensive and very doable/feasible. If you don't want to do that and are OK with spreading your classes around...

1. *Fill out your three free character slots first and foremost*. Frankly this is recommended either way. More characters equals more goodies whenever Sega hands out character specific goods like Reset Skill Tree passes. Race doesn't matter much for moment to moment gameplay and has exceedingly limited impact on stats(magic/technique using CASTs aren't uncommon for example), so pick and make what you like. You can change everything except gender down the line. Then -

  - Pick any one character to play, and go.

  - Early on you will receive an item called a Mag. **This thing is extremely important and must remain not-fucked-up**. Look at me, you, will, not, fuck, this, up,       unless you have money to burn and want to do it as a joke, but I recommend charities instead. Every character gets its own mag, it cannot be traded to other           characters or players.
    To avoid guide bloat, here is a link as to how to level a pure stat mag: https://forum.pso2.com/topic/538/tips-guide-raising-pure-mags-revised-2-5
    One thing not mentioned there: Food devices can also be bought from the player shop, not just Photon Drop Exchange. This can be bearable/cheap-ish depending on how     well you are managing your meseta gathering. Compare ship prices and decide if you want to take that plunge, or if you are OK with mag leveling taking some time.

  - Play your first character focusing on Cofy's client orders plus Daily/Weekly ARKS Missions. Cofy can be found on the right side of the gate area at the quest           counter, also memorize the location of Equipment Officer Prin to the right of her(your right, her left). Cofy's orders unlock additional missions, classes and game     important features. Any time you see an order to the effect of introducing a new mechanic or unlocking something, prioritize it. Doing this will take you through       quite a few missions and game mechanics.

  - At the same time, go to Prin on the right. Pick out three weapons for your collection sheet(ignore the 13* rank sheets, go straight to 15*). Pick at least one         Croesus weapon related to the class you are playing(if Armada is no longer in rotation, pick an Orb) and pick one Orb weapon(the end goal of this weapon will           either be enhancing fodder or be used for its augment factor. Just get any Orb weapon, and whenever the sheet fills out and gets available again, usually after 48     hours, reclaim the same weapons sheet again for a total of six times).

  - Do Urgent Quests when they pop up with boosters on. Specifically, Triboost 100%/50% and Rare Drop Rate 250%. Triboosts are often handed out by Sega and after           playing for a while you will likely end up with multiple 100s, for now, you will earn 50s via logins or the daily ARKS Missions(not quests, its a menu thing, you       fulfill conditions and get rewards). This will get your collection sheet filled out. Do not solo them until you know what you are doing.

  - Ideally, find an Alliance to join. Next to the level up dude within the gate area is the Alliance Officer. Setup up your profile according to your preferences and     either wait or actively seek out alliances. Alliances provide additional orders to fulfill plus the invaluable Buff Tree which boost your EXP rates, rare drop         rates and so on, and of course provide people to play with and so on. Note that Alliances are account bound and Ship bound, not per character. Each of your alts       will belong to the same alliance and you only have the option of joining Alliances that exist on your chosen Ship!

2. Once your Cofy orders are done and you have a better idea of whats what – your next biggest task is spamming Recommended Quest 4 until all your classes reach level 75 once, no matter the character used to reach lvl 75 with. This provides account wide boosts to stats for all your characters no matter the class being played, which is invaluable and needed for endgame. You only need to reach 75 once with every class, no matter the character you reach it with. You don't need to reach 75 say twice or thrice, that is, for example, 75 with Hunter on characters A, B and C. Reaching 75 on Hunter with Character A will unlock the buff for everyone. Note: please also refer the section on Bonus Keys above if you are considering using them for leveling.

**This should not be ignored as getting your bases to 75 can play into everything from your DPS to whether you can even equip certain things.**
Here are the class boosts offered by each class: 
![Class Boosts](https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/DwG0m-I1xMwzxQAYp4iK8EODXDyq330x1Fi6vwCQ5ZE/https/images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/AJCMiUqyynRJH1V5maF2-sW_RRTRUI2girwyiIeA54o/https/images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/s6C22qpXIteuW1H75GoSgewYnBInKsf01egZbIfudJ8/https/i.imgur.com/onj7Mho.png)

3. Have you reached level 75 on two classes? You will unlock Scion classes at this point. Hero, Phantom, Etoile and Luster. Scions/successor classes have their own special mechanics and gameplay styles and provide no boosts at level 75 and cannot carry a subclass(although Ph, Et and Lu can be used as subclass for base classes, sometimes invalidating base+base combos outright because the scions just offer better bonuses lol). Play around with them but prioritize level 75'ing the remaining bases if you haven't yet.

4. The next step after this is determining which class you want to main or play with for a while. Once you have picked that plus its subclass if relevant, its time to level these to 85 separately for unlocking the final difficulty(Ultra Hard) and gaining access to current and future endgame content. Again, use RQ4 for this plus UQ's and EXP tickets. This is also a great time to look into how the class plays in more detail if you haven't already, content after level 75 starts punishing bad play so you want to learn better PA rotations and other nooks and crannies about your chosen class. Keep in mind that the absolute final end game content requires either a 90 scion class or if using a base class, 90 on both the base and the chosen subclass.

5. As you approach Ultra Hard, its generally also a good time to start looking into affixing. This is addressed below in a basic manner with in-depth guides to be found on the PSO2 Fleet discord and youtube.

6. Its also finally time to start exploring Zig weapon exchanges! Zig is the black CAST found next to the enhancement/affixing lab, and is responsible for all endgame gear! If you've reached this point, you have no business reading this, and I implore you to seek out guides more suited to this task or to take to the Discord :)

## How do I approach Urgent Quests?
Early on most of the content is simple enough that you won't have to think too hard about this and can wing it mostly. As you approach XH difficulty however, its recommended to look up video guides if you find yourself having trouble and maybe start considering finding specific groups to run those quests with(Discord makes this easy, as does belonging to an Alliance) as PUGs(public games or pick-up-groups) can often contain players who may not know what they are doing(which is A-OK and can be part of the fun but not helpful if you are trying to farm or get specific things done). Either run a general Youtube search or check out the channels recommended in the Resources section.

## Enhancing
The games weapon and unit strengthening system. Enhancing and affixing are both carried out in the shopping plaza at the Item Lab next to the Weapon merchant on the left on the ground floor. 
Weapons below 12 rank generally feature an enhance cap of 30 and either require specialized items to raise it or more weapons of the exact same name and type, CF weapons mirror this as well base weapons acquired from Zig for his endgame series exchanges. This however is not recommended nor necessary, with one exception for Zig weapons(a yet to arrive series).
external guide link goes here

## Augments/Affixing

Augments are best thought of as stat modifiers for each weapon, along with sometimes adding gameplay changing features when it comes to S-Augments.
Augment Factors(SAF) are augments with 100% transfer rates unlocked by getting a weapon to EL 35, with certain weapons being specifically used for the Factors.
Affixing - If you are a very skilled player and don't easily die and are good at learning boss patterns, you could skip this. However, learning how the system works can bring benefits to any player and lead to more well-rounded and powerful characters, after all, you are playing an RPG. That said, PSO2 is very casual friendly and lenient, and you can completely ignore this mechanic until you hit UH(Ultra Hard) if you so wish. UH, its advisable to partake and make use of it but a very skilled player can still get by without(but obviously at more risk to themselves and with less efficacy during MPA quests plus urgents).
The base concepts are simple but the game does a horrible job of teaching them. In-depth guides can be found on the Fleet discord plus on youtube with the affixing simulator also simplifying things a lot, my task is to help you understand some basic things/avoid a few common mistakes:
   - Affixing requires two or more items. The non-main items(the ones you choose after the first one, called fodders) used in affixing need to hold the same number of      “slots”(augments) as the base or main item you first choose, or need to have a higher amount.
   
  - Below 8 slots, you will notice the option to add an additional affix whenever affixing, with reduced success rates for every other affix if attempted. This is         called upslotting and can be made easier with Augmentation Aids which are acquired via ARKS Missions, some titles, and more frequently and reliably at steep-ish       costs that even out around UH at the EX-Cube Exchange Shop(shopping plaza, floor 2 right side from the entrance). 8 slots are the maximum you can have. Each           upslot has increased risk with 8s being the riskiest to make. 
    Downslot by contrast is where you purposely take a weapon anf re-affix it, but choose one less than the amount of augments it already holds, thereby reducing its       amount. This can be relevant for if you find high slot affixes too challenging or heavy on your meseta/ex-cubes, and want to go for a lower slot number that will       be easier for you.

  - Using items with the same name leads to increased affixing success % chance, but each item needs to be the literal same. If even one fodder differs, the bonus is       lost.

  - Augmenting is made easier with augment factors, an augment that shows up during affixing with every weapon once enhanced to maximum(35). Augment factors are also       subject to upslot penalties, but the base 100% success rate plus the fact you can reuse it endlessly when upslotting the 35+ weapon makes it very valuable. More       importantly, certain augments are best gotten via augment factors, such as Reverie Catalysts from any Profound series weapon thats been enhanced to 35.

  - Augments also come as s-augments, which generally come either in capsules or with specific 13* and above weapons or as augment factors(generally 13* and above         only). Only weapon type with s-aug compatibility(shown in the info window) can use them, being compatible with anywhere from S1 to S5. S-Augs can be transferred       with 100% success rates between weapons with the Transfer S-Augment option, although the weapon giving away the S-Aug will be downslotted unless an s-aug is           transferred from the main onto it. S-Augs are also unaffected by upslotting or affixing penalties, essentially making them 'safe slots' for your                       upslotting/affixing business that you don't need to worry about.

  - Even useless S-grade augments are worth keeping for the sole purpose of making high slot affixes less risky. If the weapon is important and about to be upslotted,     slap some s-augs on it if supported and watch the entire process become ten times more bearable because the game can no longer troll you by failing your 90% affix     success rate by downslotting you to two, from six. Yes thank you this did happen to me and yes I agree it sucked thanks so muchhhhh.

  - The same principles apply to units as well. The caveat is only 13 rarity units possess augment factors, meaning synthesized augments such as Mana Reverie are a         pain to make on them compared to weapons which can utilize augment factor from Profounds to make that one with relative ease. This is why you save your Augment         Transfer Passes for your units as they are a pain to acquire.
  
  - When enhancing weapons to 35 for their SAF, prioritize using collection folder weapons from 15 CF1 and 2 or the 13* collection folder. All of them drop at +30 and     reduce the lambda grinders you need and quickly plus 10 your weapon one 30 CF weapon at a time.
  
  Also helpful to know is that the gameplay difference between 7 slots and 8 slots is not too massive(although this may not apply to a certain endgame weapon that has not arrived at the time of writing this), so if 8 slot is too intimidating for you, 7 slots is perfectly fine. Hell, go 6 slots, just...try to get good-ish affixes, even if budget.

## Bonus Keys and how to best use them!

Firstly: **Rainbows are recommended only on characters at or above level 80**. Keys scale with player level and Golld/Silver/Kazuchi/Rappy Fever/Magatsu do not scale after 70. Rainbows have the strongest effect at 80 and above as a result, as well as offering the best loot out of all.
We recommend to save your Tokyo Silvers, golds and rainbows, rappy fevers and kazuchi assaults for PSO2 Day unless they are expiring.
Tokyo keys are of most use for leveling, Rappy Fever provides materials for leveling rings while Magatsu keys provide SG(and are thus best run as soon as possible).
On PSO2 Day, 2nd of the month for F2P Players, 22nd for premium sub players, the recommended method is to *exchange all your expired silvers for golds and then mass rush your keys on the classes/characters that need them with ALL your boosters on*, RDR 250, the highest EXP booster you have, the highest Triboost, any EX boosts. Ideally save EX boosts for rainbows unless you are confident the relevant keys will get run while that booster is still on.
The idea is to maximize booster mileage, so you pop less boosters per key spam event and get more use out of each, which is important because powerful ones like Tri 150%s or EX boosts are not handed out often or easily acquired unless spending real money like nobody's business.
That said, if Boosters and time are not a problem for you, it can make sense to run 5/10 silvers back to back.


## Where can I get X important item from?

- Ex-cubes are acquired via swapping 10-12* grade weapons for ex-cubes in the swap shop(the one accessed from menu), commonly. They are also given as rewards for CO's, ARKS Missions, titles and urgent quest rewards. 

- Grinders/lambda grinders are earned via ARKS Missions/CO's as well. One can also exchange 12* weapons for lambdas if really needed. In a pinch, you can get them from the casino and you will notice they are also an option for several exchange shops for different items such as Buster and Divide Medals. The last option is not really recommended as there are better uses for those items. More importantly, as they are relevant for enhancing things they only become relevant once you hit XH and UH, so...just play normally and most likely you will have quite a bit by the time you need them.

- Triggers(items that let you do urgent quests) can be bought at Rising Weapon Badge exchanges(same row as the ex-cube exchange shop). This is important for later farming purposes. Some 4 man triggers also drop from their 12 man versions(generally called rematches, for example, Call of the Void dropping from The Malevolent Void trigger). 4 mans can have better and more reliable drop rates at times.

- Photon Spheres are the same logic as grinders, earned via normal play. Additionally, useless  12* units can be exchanged for spheres, 5 for a single sphere. Or, if swimming in ex-cubes, you could consider swapping 10-11*s for them.

- What about meseta? The best advice for meseta is this: Do your weeklies and dailies, and look out for high meseta daily orders(specifically Bar Lodos for 250K meseta). Another option that gives ok meseta but is time consuming is spamming extreme quests, **specifically Ruins & Oceanids extreme at stages 36-40**. A much better is opening a player shop, player shop passes can be earned by drawing FUN scratch tickets(very low chance), which is something you want to be doing frequently. Thankfully 1000 FUN tickets are easily bought at the EX-Cube exchange shop, so inventory management is the only real problem. Save valuable items(check via 'Check Item Market Prices') and then put them up for sale once you get your 3 day personal shop pass! FUN is earned by regular play, liking things on lookbook, sending kudos' and other things.

- 'I need this augment...' check the wiki! They often have drop locations or equipment listed! If not listed or you can't find it, come ask in the PSO2 Fleet discord :)

- Diard/Plania/GolX/Sapphard – These are earned by dismantling 13* and above weapons. Diards via 15* dismantling. In essence if you are looking at Zig exchanges thinking about this, don't worry about it until you hit UH.

- Chronos Eternistone, Founders Amphitrite and Key Rivalates' are exceedingly rare drops from quite a few Ultra Hard quests such as Wisdom Incarnate and The Malevolent Void, and otherwise can be earned as title rewards(especially title milestones, going up to 800 titles for a Rivalate Key).

- Void Erebite Fragments for Zig exchange Profound/Starquake/Trailblazer weapon and units can be farmed in the quests The Malevolent Void and The Call of the Void.

- Ultimate Boosters drop from most Ultra Hard quests.

- Luminfragment Emels + Granias are acquired by doing Divide Quests enough times to earn the required points. Stages 1-10 are used more often for Divide Medal farming, whereas 20+ are used for Divide Points. This however is high level content so you won't need to think about it for a while. Once ready, look up guides to Divide Quests as it can be a bit tricky(and also fun AF) to do em.

- Exegul modules are dropped from the titular boss at Stage 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 Divide Quests, with 5-15 being recommended. Varuna and Mitra drop at 25 and 30(30 is guaranteed battle), in all cases you need to kill the boss, S-ranking is not enough. Shiva modules drop from the Urgent Quest Armada: The Final Lament, guaranteed 3 upon quest completion, with RNG-dependant possibility for Exegul, Varuna and Mitra.

Of special note is the Extreme Quest: Risk Realm, both 4 man and solo versions. They drop Ultimate Boosters, a low amount of Divide Medals, Buster Medals, Ultimate Boosters as well as high rarity weapons and units with a possibility for dropping that one S-Augment you so desperately want! It is commonly most played alongside Divide Quests in endgame.

## What even is endgame in PSO2?
Many MMO's have specific raids  that can only be done via top tier weapon and well built classes. This sn't the case with PSO2, where even poorly skilled(skill tree or reflexes) players can technically tackle the highest level content. PSO2 has no definitive final goal, except the one you set for yourself.
Here's my take on endgame: 
You either fashion competitively, or you go the DMC/character action games route - try to get better at the game and see how well you can tackle certain quests or bosses(the endgame ones specifically), how fast, how high you can get your DPS. Think Depth 999 Masquerade(Ultimate Quest: Remnants of a Parallel World).
And or affixing shenanigans, can you get ALL the endgame affixes without losing your mind?
Or do you just do the story and tap out till another update?
Will you make a machinima series out of PSO2?
Make of it what you will, and more importantly, have fun with it :)

## Ultra Hard and Beyond
This section will generally be used for providing guides to the current relevant and/or high difficulty content in PSO2. So if you seek guides for say, Ultimate Quests, please refer elsewhere.
For now, that content is Divide Quests: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s1lF4i1RNqkIdJtJq1QMbpEfTonbTkebT8Fepi5-tuQ]
Of additional note are:
- The Limited Quest that is currently ongoing which can boost drop rates and exp rates for itself and Armada: Final Lament urgent quest.
- Armada: Final Lament is an important urgent quest for getting your Shiva module requirements filled out and also potentially drops Exegul, Mitra and Varuna modules.
- Extreme Quest: Risk Realm features potentially powerful S-Aug as well as Aug drops and can be solo'd.
